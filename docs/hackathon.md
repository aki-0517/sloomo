- This includes use of Solana Mobile Stack (SMS), Mobile Wallet Adapter, and other native mobile capabilities

### Android Requirement
- Your submission must be a functional Android app that can be published on the dApp Store

### Prize Eligibility Rules
#### Projects with Previous Funding or Prizes
- Projects that have raised funding are not eligible
- Projects who have won cash prizes in 2025 are not eligible for cash prizes
- However, you may still be eligible for bonus prizes such as launch & marketing support, Seeker devices, and calls with Anatoly

#### Colosseum BREAKOUT Hackathon Winners
- If you received a prize from the Colosseum BREAKOUT hackathon, you are not eligible for cash prizes
